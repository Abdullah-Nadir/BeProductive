### Introducing the Inspiration Behind BeProductive:

The idea for BeProductive sprang from my own everyday struggle. I used to juggle calendars, notes, and a bunch of other tools to track my progress. But
checking past days progress meant sorting through all those scattered notes—quite a task! To ease this and other issues, I created BeProductive. It's a
web app that's meant to simplify things for folks like me, making daily progress tracking a breeze.



## How to use (Features)

To begin, head over to the start route. Here, jot down your starting note and list all the tasks you aim to conquer for the day. Once you're set, hit the
